In this project, a list of songs is created (like playlists in a music app) using the BRIDGES API online dataset. The dataset structure for the songs consists of the title, release date, artist, album, and lyrics. The MySong class holds information about songs, and the SongList class implements Linked Lists. The BRIDES API SLelement is used for nodes. Data is manipulated by implemented methods.
